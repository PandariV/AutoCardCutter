Jones 1 (Van Jones, Thu December 5, 201, Fractured America got together on this issue. And it could point the way for more, CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2019/12/05/opinions/criminal-justice-reform-bipartisanship-jones/index.html, VP)
Van Jones is CEO of REFORM Alliance and co-founder of #cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. He is also the author of "Beyond the Messy Truth: How We Came Apart, How We Come Together." In 2009, Jones worked as the Green Jobs Adviser in the Obama White House. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Read more opinion on CNN. (CNN)In this era of extreme political division, one issue is bringing people together: the need to invest in public safety solutions that reduce crime and make the criminal justice system fairer.For the first time in my life, it appears every presidential candidate is running as a champion of criminal justice reform -- including (to the shock of many) Donald J. Trump. It is an astonishing reversal in both political parties. For decades, ambitious politicians tried to outdo each other with "lock 'em up" policies and "tough-on-crime" rhetoric.This dynamic accelerated after George H.W. Bush crushed Massachusetts Democrat Michael Dukakis in the 1988 presidential race. Popular wisdom attributed the win to television ads spotlighting a prisoner named Willie Horton, who committed heinous crimes while part of Dukakis' prison furlough program. Afterward, generations of politicians were afraid to champion prison reform.So, how did justice reform emerge as the one cause that brings people together? The answers are complicated -- and surprising.I have a special perspective on the topic. In California, the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights, which I co-founded in 1996, helped to close five abusive youth prisons; we also blocked construction of a draconian "super jail for youth" near Oakland. Five years ago, I co-founded the Dream Corps' #cut50 campaign with Jessica Jackson and Matt Haney, through which we passed more than a dozen bipartisan criminal justice bills at the state level, plus last year's federal First Step Act. This year, I helped launch the REFORM Alliance, which aims to shrink and transform the probation and parole systems. I have dedicated my life to this cause. But I have never seen anything like 2019 -- a year in which all presidential candidates and both parties are fighting over who can be trusted to put fewer people behind bars while reducing crime.The magic momentAny shift of this magnitude has many causes. Let's explore the top five: 1. The trifectaWe are benefiting from an extraordinary trifecta: low crime rates, a strong economy and both parties being fed up with our bloated, ineffective prison system.Politicians can more easily embrace reform when job numbers are up. President Barack Obama helped put the US economy into recovery and, under Trump, unemployment has continued to decline. Now, there are more open jobs in some cities than there are qualified workers. And yet, too many job categories still exclude people with criminal records. But, in this economy, more employers are willing to hire formerly incarcerated people, and more lawmakers are willing to invest in job training, "second chance" and "clean slate" bills to help the formerly incarcerated start new lives.Finally, lawmakers eventually got frustrated investing billions into a system that was failing to rehabilitate a majority of people who came into contact with it. Incarceration fatigue opened the door to new ways of thinking about crime prevention that address underlying causes -- like mental health, drugs, trauma, etc. And so leaders began shifting resources to create specialty courts -- veterans courts, drug courts, mental health courts -- across the country.2. Culture shiftThe television series, "Orange is the New Black," brought binge-watching Americans inside the lives of women living behind bars. Ava DuVernay's explosive documentary, "The 13th," and Netflix series, "When They See Us," broke hearts. Other documentaries and podcasts, from "Time: The Kalief Browder Story" to "Serial," opened the public's eyes. Authors like Michelle Alexander and Bryan Stevenson shook the consciences of those who read their works. Shaka Senghor's bestselling book, "Writing My Wrongs," won the admiration of Oprah Winfrey and helped to open the floodgates for formerly incarcerated authors. And in recent years, household names like Common, John Legend, Alicia Keys and Kim Kardashian have become outspoken advocates.This wave of popular media pushed into mainstream living rooms and reached beyond the pool of those who once paid attention to the incarceration system. It is now common knowledge that the United States, shamefully, has the highest incarceration rate in the world.3. Democratic value: JusticeMany people assume that Democrats always opposed mass incarceration. That is a myth. Democrats overwhelmingly backed President Bill Clinton's disastrous 1994 crime bill. The deep blue state of California just recently began to dig itself out of an incarceration crisis that resulted in the construction of more than 20 prisons but only one university in the past generation. And the national Democratic Party's platform carefully excluded any reference to criminal justice reform until 2016.So, what changed? Many things -- from #BlackLivesMatter to the opioid crisis.Seeing African American communities devastated by decades of overpolicing and excessive incarceration, a new generation of black activists rebelled. Starting in 2013, they demanded that Democrats address head-on the issues of racist police abuse and racial bias in the justice system. Their passion gave more political room for traditional civil rights and civil liberties organizations to accelerate their own longstanding reform efforts.Their grass-roots protests also gave Obama a greater impetus and opportunity to champion criminal justice reform. He took full advantage -- granting clemency to close to 2,000 inmates, pushing hard for bipartisan legislation and even becoming the first-ever sitting US president to visit a prison. His attorneys general, Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, reshaped the Department of Justice -- with a focus on incarcerating fewer people. And, in 2016, Hillary Clinton's platform included a plank calling for criminal justice reform -- an issue no nominee had touched for decades.Pushed past the breaking point, the incarceration generation rose up and insisted that Democrats speak out boldly against the racial injustice in the system. Today, all Democrats echo their call. The protests that started in 2013 have yielded a Democratic Party today that is more firmly grounded in its core ideals of racial, gender and social justice.But Democrats also know the Republicans aren't going to "Willie Horton" them, since so many conservatives are also embracing the cause.  4. Republican value: LibertyMany on the left doubt the sincerity of criminal justice reformers on the right. They can't believe that Republicans would truly care about a "racial justice" issue. But the truth is that Republicans have their own reasons to oppose the incarceration industry.Republicans care a lot about public safety. But the "tough on crime" system made many communities less safe. Today, many conservatives want an evidence-based system that focuses on reducing crime. They've returned to principles that resonate deeply on the right as they joined the fight for reform.One such principle is the need for fiscal prudence with taxpayer dollars and less government waste. Fiscal conservatives balk at the $80 billion annual price tag of mass incarceration. That's one reason Republican governors, like Rick Perry in Texas and Nathan Deal in Georgia, passed reform bills that saved millions of dollars and (in Texas) even closed several prisons, all while bringing the crime rate down.  Another conservative principle is the desire for transparency, accountability and limits on government overreach. Libertarians especially don't want the government to have too much power over individual lives. The Koch brothers fall into this category. So do US Sens. Mike Lee and Rand Paul and advocacy groups like FreedomWorks.Yet another conservative value is the faith-based belief in human dignity. Religious conservatives, including Newt Gingrich, worry the present system leaves no real opportunity for second chances or personal redemption. When he was the Republican governor of Mississippi, Phil Bryant explicitly cited his Christian faith as the source of his passion for prison reform.Black pro-Trump conservatives like Candace Owens and Katrina Pierson are working to return a pro-Lincoln, pro-freedom ethic inside the GOP on this issue.In theory, of course, all conservatives should oppose a big, failed government bureaucracy that produces bad outcomes while eating up taxpayer dollars. America's massive prison industry today represents a classic case of this phenomenon. And more and more Republicans -- from Right on Crime to Faith & Freedom Coalition to The American Conservative Union Foundation -- are willing to say so.5. The Trump factorThen there is the most surprising plot twist of all: Trump's decision to release Alice Johnson.  The world watched as Johnson, a 63-year-old grandmother who had been sentenced to die in prison, ran across the road into her family's arms. We began to hear the President shift from describing himself as "tough on crime" to expressing that he's tough but fair and recognizing the disproportionate sentencing in the justice system. Surrounded by law enforcement, faith leaders, Republican members and even several Democrats, Trump then endorsed adding sentencing reform to the First Step Act, which he signed into law later that year. Because many red state governors took the lead, this Republican President could engage on criminal justice reform without risking his base. More importantly, key people in Trump's inner circle -- including his son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- were strong allies. This opened the door for formerly incarcerated people (on the left and right) to make repeated visits to the White House, sharing their experiences with senior officials of how the existing system failed them.People on both sides of the aisle should be glad that Trump decided to adopt the cause -- and not crush it. Criminal justice reform could have fallen into a divisive stalemate like guns, climate or immigration. Instead, Trump's decision to embrace criminal justice reform has set Republicans free to work with Democrats. That's a good thing for both parties -- and a very good thing for the people suffering behind bars.Lessons beyond criminal justiceI've spent time in red states, blue states, Appalachia and urban neighborhoods. I see the same problems everywhere: generational poverty, addiction, underperforming schools, lack of access to mental health services and a broken criminal justice system. Neither party has been able to make a real dent in these problems facing low-income communities. The sad truth is that Republicans get a lot of votes from poor, rural communities -- but have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. Democrats get a lot of votes from poor, urban communities -- but we have failed to sufficiently improve conditions or expand opportunity there. That's why I came to believe in bottom-up bipartisanship -- centered on addressing the pain of the people at the bottom in both parties.However, here is what I know: Change is possible -- and criminal justice reform is evidence of that. As recently as 2014, the idea of "bipartisan criminal justice reform" was an oxymoron. Now it is almost a cliché. And, symbolically, Alice Johnson has replaced Willie Horton as the iconic image of a formerly incarcerated person. When I started 25 years ago, politicians in both parties promised to lock up more people, treat them more harshly and keep them behind bars longer. Today, leaders in both parties say we should lock up fewer people, help them transform their lives and send them home better, not bitter.Criminal justice reform is renewing the right's dedication to individual "liberty" and deepening the left's commitment to social "justice." As a result, we still have a chance to build a country with "liberty" and "justice" for all.

Shortell 19 (David Shortell, Sat November 9, 2019, He was one of the first prisoners released under Trump's criminal justice reform law. Now he's accused of murder., CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2019/11/09/us/first-step-act-release-alleged-murder/index.html, VP)
Providence, Rhode Island (CNN)Joel Francisco was 14 years into a life sentence for selling crack cocaine when he got his second chance.A landmark piece of criminal justice reform legislation, passed with the support of President Donald Trump and rare bipartisan backing, had made Francisco newly eligible for an older law that reduced the sentences for convicted crack dealers.Behind bars, the former gang leader had made "significant efforts toward post-conviction rehabilitation" and had separated himself from the "proverbial 'herd'" while "committing himself to a law-abiding life," he wrote in an application for his release.In February, with the approval of federal prosecutors and a district court judge, Francisco became one of the first federal prisoners to walk free as a result of the First Step Act.Last month, he was handcuffed again, accused this time of stabbing to death 46-year-old Troy Pine at a Providence, Rhode Island, hookah lounge.More than 4,700 inmates have been released from prison under the law since its signing late last year, according to the Department of Justice, and federal officials believe Francisco is the first among them to be accused of murder.While an outlier, his case is raising questions and resurfacing concerns from detractors of the legislation."This case is upsetting but it's not a surprise," said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who was one of the bill's biggest critics on Capitol Hill. "Letting violent felons out of prison early as the First Step Act did leads to more crime and more victims."Other lawmakers who supported the bill called the incident a tragedy, but hoped that it wouldn't stand in the way of more progress."If you're looking at reforming the criminal justice system you cannot pick an individual criminal act to then raise the question as to whether or not you do reforms to the system," said Rep. Karen Bass, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus.For police in Providence, Francisco was a known quantity. Nicknamed the "crown prince" of the Latin Kings gang by prosecutors -- and "Joey Crack" on the street, according to the Rhode Island US attorney's office -- Francisco had a reputation for violence. At age 19 he was convicted of assault with intent to murder. And by 2004, he'd become the top target in a multi-agency drug trafficking investigation codenamed Operation Royal Flush.Francisco was arrested that year alongside several other accused dealers and charged with possession with intent to sell cocaine and crack cocaine. He was convicted at trial and received a mandatory life sentence on the crack cocaine count as a result of two prior felony drug convictions.His release this year raised eyebrows among police leaders who knew him."I hope that he's been rehabilitated. However, I have serious doubts, having known him the way I did all those years," Providence police Commander Thomas Verdi told the Providence Journal at the time. "He had a propensity for violence."Francisco soon moved into a small brick apartment connected to the Providence church where his father was a pastor. In a brief interview last month, Samuel Francisco told CNN that he'd been trying to get his son's life on track.Francisco is not yet represented by an attorney on the murder charge.Francisco's release came under a provision of the First Step Act aimed to make up for a disparity in federal sentencing that had seen convicted dealers of crack cocaine face far greater prison time than sellers of the powdered form of the drug.The sentencing gap, which had an outsized impact along racial lines, was narrowed by legislation in 2010, but it wasn't until the 2018 law that people who had been imprisoned before 2010, like Francisco, became eligible for the reform.As of last month, 1,540 men and women have been released just as a result of the drug resentencing provision, according to the Department of Justice. Thousands more have been released early under a different part of the First Step Act that recalculated how prisoners earn early release credit for good time served, and the Justice Department is in the final stages of releasing a tool that will help match inmates with recidivism reduction programs. By the time he applied for early release, Francisco had studied resume writing and job interview skills. He'd logged 360 hours of culinary arts classes and earned certificates for coursework in conflict management and drug abuse.But by July, Joel Francisco was back in police custody, accused of trying to break into his ex-girlfriend's house. To defenders of the legislation, the incident was a missed red flag. According to a police report, Francisco's ex-girlfriend called authorities in the early morning hours after hearing someone tampering with her bedroom window and trying to cut through the screen. When patrol officers arrived, they say they found Francisco standing on the front porch of the house. An "unknown object" he tossed into the bushes was determined later to be a black folding knife, police wrote in a narrative. There were conflicting stories about Francisco and his ex's interactions leading up to the incident, however, and after the arrest, the ex-girlfriend submitted paperwork to withdraw her complaint, state prosecutors said.Still, prosecutors saw enough evidence of a crime and moved forward with charges. Francisco entered an initial not guilty plea, and had planned to fight the case, his lawyer told the Providence Journal. The lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN.In an interview, Francisco's ex-girlfriend, who did not want to be named, said Francisco may have struggled to transition back into a world outside prison."A person that does a long sentence as him should not just be released, and should be released with some type of mental help and to get them established, because the only thing I can think of is this person is still in his jail-zone in his mind," she said.Although Francisco was under supervised release as part of the terms of his reduced sentence, word of the July arrest, on state charges, did not make it to federal prosecutors in Rhode Island, according to a Justice Department official.Francisco's probation officer elected not to inform the local US attorney's office, who could have then moved to revoke his release, instead opting to provide counseling to Francisco, according to the head of Rhode Island's district court, which oversees the local US probation office.After a review, the court determined the probation officer's move was "appropriate and consistent with current district practices," Chief Judge William E. Smith said in a statement.Investigators are now attempting to determine why, as police allege, Francisco grew violent late on the night of October 2.It's the same question that the family of Troy Pine is asking as well."I don't want to wish that man any ill will. I don't want any harm to come to him. I just want answers," Pine's nephew, Jay Chattelle, said in an interview.Chattelle, just months younger than the uncle he called a hardworking and lovable "ladies man," expressed concern over Francisco's early release. But said he still supported the reforms put in place by the First Step Act, and advocated for more work to be done to prepare prisoners for re-entry into society."It's a flawed system. It's a beautiful program to get people to come home that don't need to be dying in jail, don't need to be living their life in jail, but there have got to be more steps. Some people have to be held accountable," Chattelle said.Chattelle's message of forgiveness and progress, in a case with no parallel, have resonated beyond Providence.At an oversight hearing on the First Step Act before the House Judiciary Committee last month, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a top Democrat in Congress, read aloud a letter that Chattelle had written about his uncle's death."Anyone who speaks my uncle's name," Jeffries read from Chattelle's letter, "please speak it in a way that will draw people together and bring help to people in these communities, including human beings who have been locked up for too long. Speak it in a way that brings healing to people who need it."

Jones 19 (Van Jones, Tue May 14, 2019, Our criminal justice system is built to inflict pain. Here's how we can heal it. , CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2019/05/14/us/criminal-justice-reform-first-step-act-redemption-project-van-jones/index.html, VP)
Van Jones is the host of the "The Van Jones Show" and a CNN political commentator. He is the CEO of REFORM Alliance, an organization aiming to reduce the number of people serving unjust parole and probation sentences, and the co-founder of #cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. (CNN)California's San Quentin is one of the oldest prisons in the country. Located on a parcel of land jutting out into the San Francisco Bay, the mammoth 167-year-old facility has a lonely and intimidating look from the outside -- and on the inside, it's just as forlorn. None of this should be surprising; that's how our criminal justice system has designed these facilities. American prisons are built on the idea of retributive justice, where the primary goal is to punish and seek vengeance. It's a model that aims to incapacitate people who commit crimes and create powerful, painful incentives for them to act right in the future. The bottom line: You harm someone, and we harm you. You hurt others, and you will hurt.This approach makes some intuitive sense. The problem is that adding harm to harm inevitably produces more harm. Too often, people come out of prison bitter -- not better. While they're locked away, their children suffer and may be led astray. And rather than derailing the cycle of violence and trauma, our system's retributive approach may often support and even accelerate that destructive cycle: According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 68% of state prisoners are arrested again within three years.This system also isn't good for victims of crime. Retribution intentionally damages the offender, but it can also accidentally leave victims with new injuries by neglecting their needs and silencing their voices. In the present system, victims and their loved ones are barely involved in the process of meting out justice. As soon as the crime is committed, a huge professional apparatus kicks in, and a massive, inhuman bureaucracy takes over. The police, lawyers, investigators, jurors and judges all start doing whatever they think is right. Neither the crime victims nor their family members get to ask their own questions, determine the punishment or seek an apology. During a trial, practically everyone talks except the people actually impacted.After a trial, those convicted of a crime are sometimes legally forbidden to contact the people they hurt, even to offer an apology. The system attempts to shield survivors from unwanted contact with the wrongdoer, but that also robs victims of the opportunity to ask the questions that haunt them: "Why?" "What were you thinking?" "What were my son's last words?"As a result, the amount of communication between the two parties is practically nonexistent -- except for an impact statement from the victims, delivered right before the guilty party is sentenced.We know that this system isn't working. To help cure what ails our justice system, reform advocates say, we need to think differently. We need to think about restoration.Restorative justice shifts our understanding of crime and punishment and asks us to use a completely different logic. The goal is not to create more damage, but to create more healing -- often through a dialogue between a crime survivor and the person who hurt them. The goal is not to add more pain, but to ameliorate as much pain as possible. At the end of the day, the goal is for all parties -- and the community itself -- to be restored to whatever degree of wellness and wholeness is possible. It seeks accountability from the trespasser, but ultimately healing for everyone involved.That's why in these conversations between those who harmed and those who were harmed, there usually isn't a big audience or large army of professionals -- just a facilitator and some support people, maybe five people total. The process involves tremendous emotional and logistical preparation, including trading questions in advance.These exchanges come out of older, wiser traditions that recognize the many dimensions of harm, and that many threads of connection are severed when someone commits a crime. In these traditions, villagers would sit in circles, discuss the issue and find a just way forward -- to restore the dignity and sense of belonging for both the victim and the perpetrator.We are rediscovering that spiritual wisdom today, and it is changing lives. I recently visited San Quentin for an episode of "The Redemption Project" to meet a young man named Chris Smith. When Chris was 16, after a rough upbringing that led him into gang life, he says he followed orders to shoot at a car parked outside a high school. He did not realize that one of his former classmates -- LoEshé Lacy -- who was only 16 herself was in the car. LoEshé was killed and he had to face the consequences.Chris was convicted of murder and eventually found himself in San Quentin. The first few years were rough. But then he found a series of programs in prison that introduced him to restorative justice -- and for Chris, it changed everything.Through restorative justice, he began a process of rehabilitation and self-reflection that led to a remarkable dialogue with Donald Lacy, LoEshé Lacy's father. And Donald finally got more insight into what led Chris into gang culture and to the terrible decisions that took his daughter's life. I was lucky enough to witness the encounter -- and to film it for CNN viewers -- as a part of "The Redemption Project."The really good news is that something new is brewing, not just in San Quentin, but across the criminal justice system. In fact, it has even reached Washington. With massive bipartisan majorities, both houses of Congress last year passed The First Step Act, the most significant piece of criminal justice reform legislation in decades.The First Step Act began with a recognition that prisons can't just be places of punishment. They must also create opportunities for rehabilitation and transformation. The law expands programming throughout the federal prison system and adds incentives that encourage men and women to pursue classes that will help them successfully return to their families and communities. It also scaled back some of the harshest criminal penalties like mandatory life sentences for third-strike drug offenses and retroactively applies other reforms to give thousands of people an opportunity to petition a judge for their freedom. It also added important protections for incarcerated women, banned solitary confinement for juveniles, and much more.But we will still need second, third, and fourth steps -- fully implementing the act quickly and effectively, rolling back other lengthy prison sentences (and continuing to do so retroactively to bring home as many people as we safely can), investing in alternatives to incarceration, scaling back systems of mass supervision like probation and parole, reducing barriers for people with criminal records, and so much more.The First Step Act at least opens the door to begin that wholesale rethinking of our criminal justice system. No longer are retribution and incapacitation the sole aims of our public safety policies. Now, rehabilitation officially matters, too. And for some, nothing is more powerfully rehabilitative than sitting face-to-face with people you have harmed, in an effort to heal.

Kann 1 (Drew Kann, Sun April 21, 201, 5 facts behind America's high incarceration rate, CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/28/us/mass-incarceration-five-key-facts/index.html, VP)
 (CNN)Year after year, the United States beats out much larger countries -- India, China -- and more totalitarian ones --Russia and the Philippines -- for the distinction of having the highest incarceration rate in the world.According to a 2018 report from the Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS), nearly 2.2 million adults were held in America's prisons and jails at the end of 2016. That means for every 100,000 people residing in the United States, approximately 655 of them were behind bars.If the US prison population were a city, it would be among the country's 10 largest. More people are behind bars in America than there are living in major cities such as Philadelphia or Dallas. But after decades of explosive growth, there are signs that the country is turning the corner on mass incarceration.The prison population decreased in 2016 for the third straight year, and prison reform, in general, is one of the rare issues with bipartisan support on Capitol Hill and in the White House.   On the other hand, approximately $80 billion is still spent each year on corrections facilities alone, according to a Prison Policy Initiative report, dwarfing the $68 billion discretionary budget of the Department of Education.Clearly, this issue is complicated. To better understand who the system impacts, it requires looking beyond the big numbers. Here are five key facts that bring the scope of the criminal justice system into focus.Most inmates are held in state prisons and local jails -- not federal prisons.Prison reform solutions often focus on the federal government, but the vast majority of incarcerated people are held in facilities controlled by state and local governments, according to the Prison Policy Initiative.The nonpartisan think tank found that more than 1.3 million people are held in state prisons, while more than 600,000 people behind bars are in one of the country's 3,000+ local jails.These jails -- sometimes dubbed the "front door" of the criminal justice system -- often hold people who haven't yet been convicted of a crime.In many cities and states, money often decides who stays in jail and who gets out.The BJS reports that in 2016, nearly two-thirds of all inmates in local jails were not convicted.So why were they behind bars? Many who are arrested and go to jail are able to get out quickly by simply posting bail. But those who can't afford it are essentially trapped -- they either sit in jail until the court takes action, or work with a bail bond agent to secure their freedom (with the latter option often saddling them with debt). Advocates will quickly point out how this system puts the poor at a huge disadvantage. Stuck in jail because they can't afford to pay bail, inmates are unable to work or support their families, making them particularly susceptible to the spiral of debt and incarceration.The bail bond business, as with others tied to the criminal justice system, is extremely lucrative, bringing in more than $2 billion in profit each year, according to a 2017 report by nonprofit civil rights advocacy group Color of Change and the ACLU's Campaign for Smart Justice.The 'war on drugs' isn't solely to blame for mass incarceration.Some have said that the "war on drugs" is responsible for America's massive prison and jail populations.   And while this rings true in many federal prisons -- where nearly half of all inmates are locked up for drug charges, often serving lengthy sentences -- it's a different story in state prisons and local jails.In these facilities, where the vast majority of incarcerated people are housed, Prison Policy Initiative says those held for drug offenses are a much smaller proportion of the overall population.  But this still oversimplifies the relationship between drugs and mass incarceration.For one, there is huge variation from state-to-state in how drug policies are enforced, according to a Pew analysis. States like Louisiana and Oklahoma, for instance, lock up drug offenders at rates far exceeding most others.Though drugs may not be the primary reason most people are in state and local prisons, law enforcement agencies around the country are still making drug arrests in huge numbers.In 2016, drug arrests actually increased about 10% from the previous year to more than 1.25 million, according to the FBI's Uniform Crime Report.   Once you're in the criminal justice system, it's often difficult to get out.For some, just one arrest is enough to get caught up in the system. There have been several studies on recidivism, but one of the most extensive was released in 2016 by the United States Sentencing Commission (USSC), which tracked more than 25,000 federal offenders over an eight-year period.Officials reported that nearly half of those monitored were rearrested for a new crime or for a violation of supervision conditions. And for about half, it took less than two years for them to run afoul of the law again.Other studies have found correlations between the length of a person's rap sheet and the likelihood of recidivism.A 2017 USSC study showed that offenders without any previous contact with the criminal justice system had an 11.7 percent lower recidivism rate than those with at least some prior contact with law enforcement.Minorities are still overrepresented in the prison population, but racial and ethnic gaps are shrinking.It has been a defining characteristic of the criminal justice system for years, and it's still the case today: compared to the racial makeup of the overall US population, African-Americans continue to make up a disproportionate amount of the prison population. (Nonprofit organizations such as The Vera Institute have written extensively about this issue.)Though African-Americans comprise only about 12% of the total US population, they represent 33 percent of the federal and state prison population. That's compared to whites, who constitute 64% of American adults but just 30% of those behind bars, according to a Pew Research analysis of Bureau of Justice Statistics data.But as the overall incarcerated population has slowly retreated from its peak in 2009, a shift is happening in American prisons: the disparity between the number of African-Americans and whites locked up is shrinking.Between 2009 and 2016, Pew's analysis shows the African-American prison population fell 17%, exceeding the 10% drop in the number of whites behind bars. The Hispanic population was virtually unchanged over the same period.There are a number of ideas about what's behind this closing gap, from stiffer law enforcement in rural, predominately white areas, to the scourge of opioids and heroin, which have hit white communities hardest.

Diamond 18 (Jeremy Diamond, Fri December 21, 2018, How Jared Kushner, Kim Kardashian West and Congress drove the criminal justice overhaul, CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/18/politics/criminal-justice-overhaul/index.html, VP)
Washington (CNN)On the afternoon of September 5, President Donald Trump sat in the Oval Office debating  whether to throw his support behind the most extensive overhaul of prison and sentencing laws in years.Across the room, an unlikely group of allies tried to persuade him to join them. His son-in-law, Jared Kushner -- the driving force behind the effort -- had invited the liberal commentator and former Obama administration official Van Jones and celebrity Kim Kardashian West to the White House for an impromptu meeting.But first they had to deal with one problem that had been bothering the President for weeks: Willie Horton.Horton, a convicted murderer who raped a woman after he was granted a weekend furlough from prison in Massachusetts, was the subject of a withering 1988 presidential campaign ad attacking the Democratic nominee, Michael Dukakis, the Massachusetts governor at the time. The ad, which exploited racist stereotypes, was devastating to Dukakis, and Trump was worried that he could suffer his own Willie Horton moment in 2020 if he backed the bill -- a fear stoked by Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican and chief congressional opponent of the effort."He was afraid," Jones said of the President. "He was concerned someone would get out, hurt someone and that would be the end of his political career."Jones, a CNN host and commentator, and Kardashian West sought to imprint the name of another convicted felon in Trump's mind: Alice Marie Johnson, a 63-year-old woman who had been serving a life sentence for money laundering and a nonviolent drug offense until Trump granted her clemency in June to broad acclaim. Every time Trump mentioned Horton, Jones and Kardashian West reminded him of Johnson."We just kind of circled back, Van and I, in talking to the President to explain: But you have Alice now, and Alice is your legacy," Kardashian West, who had helped convince Trump last spring to commute Johnson's sentence, told CNN. "She really opened up his heart and his eyes."The half-hour meeting was just one of several pivotal moments that ultimately led Trump to endorse a groundbreaking prison and sentencing overhaul bill last month, ramping up pressure on a reluctant Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell -- who has doomed similar efforts in the past -- to bring it to the floor for a vote.On Tuesday night, the Senate passed the bill 87 to 12. Trump is expected to sign it this week before leaving for his Mar-a-Lago resort. The effort cements what is so far the biggest bipartisan victory of his presidency and turns the page on decades of policies that critics say were brutal, racist, ineffective and costly.The timing is particularly noteworthy given that it comes as nearly every aspect of the President's political and business life is under investigation, and substantive congressional policy making has practically ground to a halt.The bill's passage is also a win for Kushner, whom the bill's supporters credit with working behind the scenes to steer the legislation past significant opposition within the Trump administration and past shifting coalitions on Capitol Hill.This story, based on interviews with more than a dozen administration officials, members of Congress, and advocates and opponents of the legislation, tracks the winding journey to push the bill, known as the First Step Act, through Congress to the desk of a President who campaigned on the promise of renewing tough-on-crime policies.  At times the bill seemed poised to fail. Yet at crucial moments a surprising political alliance emerged to keep it alive, one made up of social progressives, black Democrats, members of the religious right, fiscal conservatives and libertarians. The effort has proved so resilient this time around, opponents have dubbed the First Step Act the "zombie bill" for its refusal to die.Under the legislation, thousands of federal inmates will be able to leave prison earlier than they otherwise would have. Many could secure an earlier release thanks to new credits awarded for good behavior or through participation in rehabilitation programs. The bill also eases some mandatory minimum sentences, gives judges more leeway to eschew certain sentencing guidelines and eliminates "stacking" provisions that leave offenders serving consecutive sentences for crimes committed with firearms."If this bill is the only step Congress takes, it will leave the important work of criminal justice reform substantially undone," said Ames C. Grawert, a senior counsel at the Brennan Center for Justice. "But as a real 'first step,' the bill both changes the conversation -- focusing on how we reduce federal prison sentences, not whether we do it at all -- and offers a real, immediate benefit for currently incarcerated people."A Democratic blockadeRep. Hakeem Jeffries didn't want to be seen at the White House. The New York Democrat represents parts of Brooklyn, one of the most anti-Trump districts in the country, and he was wary about the message his presence at the White House would send. So in the spring, when Kushner asked Jeffries to meet him at his office in the West Wing, he and Rep. Cedric Richmond, the Louisiana Democrat who's the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus, refused. Instead, on March 22, Kushner came to them on Capitol Hill for breakfast. Jeffries, who had been working with Richmond on overhauling the criminal justice system for years, saw it as an early sign that Kushner was serious about the issue.Still, there was deep skepticism among Democrats. Many were averse to delivering Trump a win, and felt that simply being on the same side of an issue as the President was politically dangerous, particularly given his heated rhetoric over policing and inner city crime.  In 2016, Trump repeatedly spoke about bringing back controversial police practices, like stop and frisk, that disproportionately impact black and Latino men. When Rep. John Lewis, a Georgia Democrat, said he would boycott Trump's inauguration in 2017, Trump tweeted in response that the civil rights icon "should finally focus on the burning and crime infested inner-cities of the U.S."But over months of meetings and calls with Kushner, Jeffries warmed to the idea that a criminal justice overhaul might be feasible under Trump. He found Kushner to be "authentically committed" and spent time talking with the President's son-in-law about the personal connection he had to the issue. Kushner's father, Charles, served 14 months in federal prison after pleading guilty to charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. Jeffries also found a willing cosponsor across the aisle in Republican Rep. Doug Collins of Georgia, a pastor who had seen his state's criminal justice overhaul efforts work to reduce recidivism rates.Yet a difficult path lay ahead. First, Jeffries had to deal with critics in his own party.On May 17, the Collins-Jeffries bill drew a fiery rebuke from some of the most prominent members of the Democratic Party, including Sens. Dick Durbin of Illinois, Kamala Harris of California and Cory Booker of New Jersey. The trio wrote a letter laying out the bill's faults as they saw them, including its lack of any sentencing revisions. The American Civil Liberties Union, the NAACP and other progressive groups opposed the bill.Kushner offered to get involved but Jeffries insisted on handling it himself, according to Jones. In a day, Jeffries and his staffers wrote a point-by-point rebuttal to that letter while listening to the title tracks of one of the most famous rap battles, Jay-Z's "Takeover" and Nas' "Ether." As they worked, Jeffries blasted the music on speakers in his office, according to an aide.The next week, Jeffries stood up in a private House Democratic caucus meeting to defend his bill from the opposition of House Judiciary Committee ranking member Jerry Nadler of New York, former Attorney General Eric Holder and other powerful Democrats. "What I recall is that Rep. Jeffries knew the bill in depth; answered questions fully; and removed the doubts of some completely," said Democratic Rep. Anna Eshoo of California.A few days later, the bill passed the House with 360 votes, including nearly 70% of the House Democratic caucus and almost every Republican voting in favor of it."It's clear that some elements on the hard-left unleashed everything, including the kitchen sink, to try to stop the criminal justice reform effort in the House based on the worldview of all or nothing," Jeffries told CNN. "In the House, we took the position that in order to break the back of the prison industrial complex we needed to begin with a significant, robust bipartisan effort around prison reform that could lay the foundation to get something done."Administration oppositionAs Jeffries was dealing with skeptical Democrats, Kushner was fighting with Republican opponents in the Trump administration, most notably then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions.In initial drafts, Sessions and his aides at the Justice Department worked to insert provisions that advocates of the bill considered "poison pills," including introducing a new mandatory minimum sentence -- drawing uproar from Kushner's new Democratic partners, who questioned whether the political risk of associating with the White House would be worth it."Jared and others at the White House who were working on this went to bat for us," said Jessica Jackson Sloan, who along with Jones co-founded #Cut50, a group that advocates for reducing incarceration in the US. "Jared said, 'I'm going to make sure this is right and I'm not going to let this crap happen again.' ""That was huge," Jones said.Within weeks, Jones returned the favor by appearing alongside Kushner at a May 18 White House event focused on the prison legislation. Just walking into the Trump White House, Jones said, felt like "political suicide." He and others who appeared onstage were assailed as "Uncle Toms" on social media."They didn't really understand why we were going," said Topeka Sam, a former felon who attended the White House event. "The way we looked at it was, it's our house and despite who's in there, it's our country. And if we're looking to change what's happening to our people that are incarcerated, that we need to be at the table."But the event offered proof of the bipartisan union that was coming together -- with left- and right-leaning advocates in attendance. It was also an indication that Trump was edging in favor of the bill.Seated in the front row of the gold-trimmed East Room, Mark Holden, senior vice president of Koch Industries, which has long advocated for criminal justice revisions, watched as Trump strayed from the teleprompter to make an off-script point about how a friend had hired some former prisoners who had turned out to be "superstars." "They would have never gotten the chance," said Trump.To Holden and several administration officials, the riff was a sign that Trump wasn't just going through the motions. He was in. It was also a notable affront to Sessions, who was also seated in the front row.Around the time of the event, Sessions attended a meeting at the White House with Trump, Kushner and Energy Secretary Rick Perry -- another longtime advocate of criminal justice revisions. Sessions came armed with a memorandum laying out his arguments against the bill. But he didn't get far before Trump shut him down, according to two sources familiar with the meeting.It didn't help that by then, Sessions had become a regular target of Trump's ire over his recusal from the Russia investigation. The mere fact that Sessions opposed the effort was almost enough to make the President support it.  "Trump liked the idea of overruling Sessions," said one person familiar with the matter.After getting his hair cut at the Senate barbershop Tuesday, Sessions declined to talk to CNN about the First Step Act on the record.August setbackBy August, momentum was building behind the bill.Early that month, the President huddled at his Bedminster golf club with a group of Republican governors supportive of a criminal justice overhaul. There -- as he would in the Oval Office a month later -- Trump raised his concerns that he could face a Willie Horton moment of his own if he backed a bill that would grant early release to some convicted felons. The governors, a senior administration official said, helped assuage Trump's concern and pointed him to the benefit of sentencing overhauls in their states.But then -- just as supporters of the bill expected a presidential endorsement was afoot -- Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican, managed to get face time with Trump while he was at the White House, reviving the President's fears of Horton and reminding him of the political danger of endorsing the bill. That same day, McConnell told Trump the prison overhaul bill was too divisive among Republicans to bring to a vote before the midterm elections, multiple sources familiar with the call told CNN.Under pressure, Trump agreed to table the issue until after the midterms."At that point, we thought everything had died," said Jones.Kushner extracted a promise from McConnell to bring the bill to a vote after the midterms if a whip count showed they had the votes. The delay gave supporters a chance to regroup and expand their coalition. Kushner began calling Sen. Mike Lee of Utah so frequently that when he interrupted Lee's family dinner during a vacation in Canada, they knew who it was. "My family said, 'Oh it's Jared, isn't it?' " Lee recalled.To gain the backing of law enforcement groups such as the Fraternal Order of Police, and National District Attorneys Associations, supporters offered a few key concessions, including one that excludes people convicted of certain fentanyl-related offenses from being eligible for early release. That helped undercut the position of Cotton and other opponents, and positioned Kushner to present a strengthened bill to the President.McConnell boxed inOn November 14, Trump delivered his endorsement in the White House Roosevelt Room, giving shout-outs to a number of Republican senators who wrote the revised bill -- Chuck Grassley, Lindsey Graham, Lee, Tim Scott, Rand Paul -- and Rep. Collins, an original co-author.By then, most Senate Democrats had also jumped on board after some key sentencing provisions were added, including one that Senate Democratic Whip Durbin fought for in 2010 that reduced the disparity between sentences for powder vs. crack cocaine. The new legislation will apply that change retroactively to about 2,600 inmates who had been convicted under the previous statute.There was still just one problem: McConnell was dragging his feet. The day after Trump gave his endorsement, the Senate majority leader told Trump in the Oval Office that he would not bring the measure up for a vote until next year, two administration officials said, pushing the careful compromise into the pit of divided government just as Democrats regain control of the House. Advocates were worried that decision could kill the bill, just as McConnell's reluctance to bring up a previous Senate bill sponsored by his whip, Sen. John Cornyn, and others stifled another effort at the end of the Obama administration.Kushner and his allies began to ramp up pressure on McConnell. Conservatives flooded his office with calls, including thousands organized by the conservative grassroots group FreedomWorks, which also mounted a pressure campaign in Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn's home state of Texas.McConnell needed to "hear from everyone who matters to him and that the cost to him of not doing this was going to be greater" than moving forward, a senior administration official said.Even Trump put on the pressure, urging McConnell several times over the phone to bring the bill to the floor. And while some urged the President to attack McConnell on Twitter, Kushner convinced him to hold his fire, trusting McConnell would ultimately relent.Lee unleashedBy the end of the month, Cornyn's office was telling the White House they didn't have the votes, claiming support for the bill was softer than it appeared, two sources familiar with the matter said.Even after Vice President Mike Pence and members of the White House legislative affairs team did their own whip count and concluded they had over 60 votes, McConnell still wouldn't commit to bringing the bill to a vote before the end of the year. So Lee went into overdrive, lobbying his fellow senators day and night, by phone, by text, in person on the Senate floor, at lunch in the Senate cafeteria. "I went nuts," Lee told CNN.A pivotal moment came when Lee's friend, the conservative Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, signed on after they added certain provisions that would make it harder for some offenders to get an early release. Cruz was number "29 or 30" in Lee's mind -- more than enough to get the bill up for a vote and easily pass the Senate.On December 10, Darrell Scott, a black pastor and early Trump supporter, warned McConnell's legal counsel that he would send hundreds of black pastors and activists -- in his words, "500 angry black people" -- to the Senate majority leader's office if he didn't take action.That evening, Kushner made his most public push yet, appearing on Trump's favorite show -- "Hannity" on Fox News -- to plug the bill.The next day, McConnell announced he would put the bill on the floor at the request of the President. Scott called McConnell to shower him with praise."I told him, 'We're going to build statues of you in the hood,' " Scott recalled.A week later, on the day the bill passed the Senate, Jones and Kushner had an early-morning phone call to coordinate their efforts."The next 48 hours are critical," Jones jokingly told Kushner, echoing a phrase he had heard from Kushner at the end of nearly every one of their calls.But the goal line was actually much closer, Kushner replied. "I actually think it's only the next 12," he said. CLARIFICATION: This story has been updated to reflect that Freedomworks is no longer associated with the Koch family.

Washington (CNN)Senators of both parties on Thursday moved forward their long-odds legislation to enact some degree of reform for the federal criminal justice system. By a vote of 16-5, and amid protests from some senators that the bill would likely face hurdles too high to pass, the Senate Judiciary Committee backed the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act, a package to reduce some of the strictest federal sentencing rules along with reforms for the federal prison system.  Ahead of the vote, Chairman Chuck Grassley expressed anger with Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who he called a friend, for coming out against the bill.  "I'm really irritated that he would send that letter considering the fact that he was very controversial before this committee to be attorney general, considering that most of the assistant attorney generals have been sent up here have been very controversial and difficult to get through this committee, considering the fact that the President was going to fire him last spring and I went to his defense," the Iowa Republican said. "I don't think that's something that somebody should do to friends." Sessions wrote in a letter CNN obtained Wednesday that the Justice Department was against the bill and he warned that it would increase violent crime and hamstring federal law enforcement. "Passing this legislation to further reduce sentences for drug traffickers in the midst of the worst drug crisis in our nation's history would make it more difficult to achieve our goals and have potentially dire consequences," Sessions said.  Sentencing and prison reform Thursday's markup showed Grassley staking his position on a comprehensive approach, rather than moving forward the Corrections Act, which is a vehicle for prison reform without the sentencing component.  Senate Majority Whip John Cornyn, a Texas Republican who is one of the lawmakers backing the prison reform approach, opposed the comprehensive package and said he did not think sentencing reform would make it into law given the current political landscape. "Call it a concession to the brevity of life," Cornyn said.  The House Judiciary Committee has similar legislation available, both sentencing reform and a bill that would reform the Federal Bureau of Prisons in the mold of several states around the nation. It is unclear when the House panel might move forward or with what approach. President Donald Trump said in his State of the Union speech last month that he supported prison reform, following White House meetings on the issue and a statement of approval from Sessions.  Cornyn and Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island expressed skepticism a week before the committee markup that the comprehensive package would make it into law, given Sessions' express opposition.  Democratic Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont said Sessions' opposition "can't be excuse for inaction," and GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said that of the two major components, "I don't see how you do one without the other." "I am for prison reform, but I am also for reform of why people stay in jail so long," Graham said. What the bill would do The bill would seek to lessen the impact of mandatory minimums, legislatively enforced minimum sentences that prevent judges from setting sentences below a certain threshold. It would also move to make reforms in the Fair Sentencing Act -- a 2010 law backed by then-Sen. Sessions to reduce the disparity in sentences between crack and powder cocaine -- retroactive for some convicts, pending court approval for those people.  On the prison reform side, it would enact the provisions of the Corrections Act, which seeks to mandate that the Bureau of Prisons put in place a new approach to re-entry and anti-recidivism programs for prisoners, like education. The powerful National Association of Assistant United States Attorneys, along with several other law enforcement groups, has come out against the bill, expressing opposition similar to Sessions'. The association claims that reducing mandatory minimums, among other sentencing provisions, would lead to an increase in violent crime. For many advocates, the bill is an acceptable compromise to implement reforms that have struggled to make it into law for years. Kevin Ring of Families Against Mandatory Minimums said he wanted the comprehensive package, and worried that prison reform alone would be ineffective for a range of reasons. One of his worries, he told CNN ahead of the markup, was that if prison reform were unsuccessful or inconclusive, opponents of criminal justice reform more generally would use that as a reason not to make further changes.  "Our biggest concern is if they call this reform and it's not meaningful, that's going to harm prospects in the future," Ring said.

Providence, Rhode Island (CNN)Joel Francisco was 14 years into a life sentence for selling crack cocaine when he got his second chance. A landmark piece of criminal justice reform legislation, passed with the support of President Donald Trump and rare bipartisan backing, had made Francisco newly eligible for an older law that reduced the sentences for convicted crack dealers. Behind bars, the former gang leader had made "significant efforts toward post-conviction rehabilitation" and had separated himself from the "proverbial 'herd'" while "committing himself to a law-abiding life," he wrote in an application for his release. In February, with the approval of federal prosecutors and a district court judge, Francisco became one of the first federal prisoners to walk free as a result of the First Step Act. Last month, he was handcuffed again, accused this time of stabbing to death 46-year-old Troy Pine at a Providence, Rhode Island, hookah lounge. More than 4,700 inmates have been released from prison under the law since its signing late last year, according to the Department of Justice, and federal officials believe Francisco is the first among them to be accused of murder. While an outlier, his case is raising questions and resurfacing concerns from detractors of the legislation. "This case is upsetting but it's not a surprise," said Sen. Tom Cotton, an Arkansas Republican who was one of the bill's biggest critics on Capitol Hill. "Letting violent felons out of prison early as the First Step Act did leads to more crime and more victims." Other lawmakers who supported the bill called the incident a tragedy, but hoped that it wouldn't stand in the way of more progress. "If you're looking at reforming the criminal justice system you cannot pick an individual criminal act to then raise the question as to whether or not you do reforms to the system," said Rep. Karen Bass, a member of the House Judiciary Committee and the chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. For police in Providence, Francisco was a known quantity. Nicknamed the "crown prince" of the Latin Kings gang by prosecutors -- and "Joey Crack" on the street, according to the Rhode Island US attorney's office -- Francisco had a reputation for violence.  At age 19 he was convicted of assault with intent to murder. And by 2004, he'd become the top target in a multi-agency drug trafficking investigation codenamed Operation Royal Flush. Francisco was arrested that year alongside several other accused dealers and charged with possession with intent to sell cocaine and crack cocaine.  He was convicted at trial and received a mandatory life sentence on the crack cocaine count as a result of two prior felony drug convictions. His release this year raised eyebrows among police leaders who knew him. "I hope that he's been rehabilitated. However, I have serious doubts, having known him the way I did all those years," Providence police Commander Thomas Verdi told the Providence Journal at the time. "He had a propensity for violence." Francisco soon moved into a small brick apartment connected to the Providence church where his father was a pastor. In a brief interview last month, Samuel Francisco told CNN that he'd been trying to get his son's life on track. Francisco is not yet represented by an attorney on the murder charge. Francisco's release came under a provision of the First Step Act aimed to make up for a disparity in federal sentencing that had seen convicted dealers of crack cocaine face far greater prison time than sellers of the powdered form of the drug. The sentencing gap, which had an outsized impact along racial lines, was narrowed by legislation in 2010, but it wasn't until the 2018 law that people who had been imprisoned before 2010, like Francisco, became eligible for the reform. As of last month, 1,540 men and women have been released just as a result of the drug resentencing provision, according to the Department of Justice. Thousands more have been released early under a different part of the First Step Act that recalculated how prisoners earn early release credit for good time served, and the Justice Department is in the final stages of releasing a tool that will help match inmates with recidivism reduction programs.  By the time he applied for early release, Francisco had studied resume writing and job interview skills. He'd logged 360 hours of culinary arts classes and earned certificates for coursework in conflict management and drug abuse. But by July, Joel Francisco was back in police custody, accused of trying to break into his ex-girlfriend's house. To defenders of the legislation, the incident was a missed red flag.  According to a police report, Francisco's ex-girlfriend called authorities in the early morning hours after hearing someone tampering with her bedroom window and trying to cut through the screen.  When patrol officers arrived, they say they found Francisco standing on the front porch of the house. An "unknown object" he tossed into the bushes was determined later to be a black folding knife, police wrote in a narrative.  There were conflicting stories about Francisco and his ex's interactions leading up to the incident, however, and after the arrest, the ex-girlfriend submitted paperwork to withdraw her complaint, state prosecutors said. Still, prosecutors saw enough evidence of a crime and moved forward with charges. Francisco entered an initial not guilty plea, and had planned to fight the case, his lawyer told the Providence Journal. The lawyer did not respond to multiple requests for comment from CNN. In an interview, Francisco's ex-girlfriend, who did not want to be named, said Francisco may have struggled to transition back into a world outside prison. "A person that does a long sentence as him should not just be released, and should be released with some type of mental help and to get them established, because the only thing I can think of is this person is still in his jail-zone in his mind," she said. Although Francisco was under supervised release as part of the terms of his reduced sentence, word of the July arrest, on state charges, did not make it to federal prosecutors in Rhode Island, according to a Justice Department official. Francisco's probation officer elected not to inform the local US attorney's office, who could have then moved to revoke his release, instead opting to provide counseling to Francisco, according to the head of Rhode Island's district court, which oversees the local US probation office. After a review, the court determined the probation officer's move was "appropriate and consistent with current district practices," Chief Judge William E. Smith said in a statement. Investigators are now attempting to determine why, as police allege, Francisco grew violent late on the night of October 2. It's the same question that the family of Troy Pine is asking as well. "I don't want to wish that man any ill will. I don't want any harm to come to him. I just want answers," Pine's nephew, Jay Chattelle, said in an interview. Chattelle, just months younger than the uncle he called a hardworking and lovable "ladies man," expressed concern over Francisco's early release. But said he still supported the reforms put in place by the First Step Act, and advocated for more work to be done to prepare prisoners for re-entry into society. "It's a flawed system. It's a beautiful program to get people to come home that don't need to be dying in jail, don't need to be living their life in jail, but there have got to be more steps. Some people have to be held accountable," Chattelle said. Chattelle's message of forgiveness and progress, in a case with no parallel, have resonated beyond Providence. At an oversight hearing on the First Step Act before the House Judiciary Committee last month, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries, a top Democrat in Congress, read aloud a letter that Chattelle had written about his uncle's death. "Anyone who speaks my uncle's name," Jeffries read from Chattelle's letter, "please speak it in a way that will draw people together and bring help to people in these communities, including human beings who have been locked up for too long. Speak it in a way that brings healing to people who need it."  

Key Republican senator pushing McConnell for vote on criminal justice bill
Rogers 18 (Alex Rogers, Tue December 4, 2018, Key Republican senator pushing McConnell for vote on criminal justice bill, CNN News, From https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/04/politics/criminal-justice-sentencing-bill-senate/index.html, VP)
 (CNN)With Congress eying to exit Washington in a few weeks, Sen. Chuck Grassley, the chairman of the influential Judiciary committee, dismissed Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's claim that a major criminal justice reform bill doesn't have the support of the majority of Republicans in the Senate. At an event Tuesday moderated by The Washington Post, the Iowa Republican said that the bill could pass in three or four days, and would lose Republican support if it gets punted to 2019, when Democrats take control of the House. "If McConnell will bring this up, it will pass overwhelmingly," Grassley said. Grassley helped write the legislation, known as the First Step Act, which would allow thousands of current and future federal inmates get out earlier, and rehabilitate back into society through halfway houses, home confinement or other supervision, by reducing drug-related mandatory sentences and making more offenders eligible for early release through earning credits awarded by completing certain activities and programs. McConnell, the Senate Republican leader, has not said publicly whether he supports or opposes the bill. When asked by CNN Tuesday whether he would put the bill on the floor this year, McConnell said "we're still talking." But McConnell said Monday in a Wall Street Journal interview that the First Step Act is "extremely divisive" among his fellow Republican senators, even though it "does have a lot of support from both" parties. After this week's services celebrating the life of the late President George H.W. Bush, McConnell noted that Congress has only two weeks before it leaves for the Christmas holiday, making it "very hard to figure out how to shoehorn" the bill through Congress. "I'm pretty confident given the broad support it has that it would pass next year," McConnell added. With the support of President Donald Trump, the First Step Act is expected to easily pass the Republican-controlled House should McConnell decide to put it up for a vote and send it to the other chamber. McConnell, however, is loathe to pass bills that split his party, and he claimed Monday that "there are more members in my conference who are either against it or undecided than are for it." Grassley disputed McConnell's math as well, tweeting Tuesday that more than half of the 51 Republican senators support the bill.  "Ldr McConnell said he would need to have 60+ votes to bring criminal justice reform up & wanted to show large amount of Republican support," Grassley tweeted. "We have delivered. More than 1/2 of the Republican caucus supports the First Step Act LET'S VOTE!" The First Step Act would also retroactively apply the 2010 Fair Sentencing Act, which reduced the disparity between powder and crack cocaine-related offenses, affecting the sentences of around 2,600 prisoners. At The Washington Post event, Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, noted that he and former Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions —a conservative and Trump's former attorney general — struck that bipartisan compromise in 2010. Durbin said he was open to negotiating other provisions in the First Step Act to bring along Senate Republicans wary of the bill. "The deal will be closed when one senator steps up and says it's time — and that's Sen. Mitch McConnell," Durbin said. This story has been updated. CNN's Ted Barrett contributed to this report. 

Our criminal justice system is built to inflict pain. Here's how we can heal it.

Van Jones is the host of the "The Van Jones Show" and a CNN political commentator. He is the CEO of REFORM Alliance, an organization aiming to reduce the number of people serving unjust parole and probation sentences, and the co-founder of #cut50, a bipartisan criminal justice initiative of the Dream Corps. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own.  (CNN)California's San Quentin is one of the oldest prisons in the country. Located on a parcel of land jutting out into the San Francisco Bay, the mammoth 167-year-old facility has a lonely and intimidating look from the outside -- and on the inside, it's just as forlorn.  None of this should be surprising; that's how our criminal justice system has designed these facilities. American prisons are built on the idea of retributive justice, where the primary goal is to punish and seek vengeance. It's a model that aims to incapacitate people who commit crimes and create powerful, painful incentives for them to act right in the future. The bottom line: You harm someone, and we harm you. You hurt others, and you will hurt. This approach makes some intuitive sense. The problem is that adding harm to harm inevitably produces more harm. Too often, people come out of prison bitter -- not better. While they're locked away, their children suffer and may be led astray. And rather than derailing the cycle of violence and trauma, our system's retributive approach may often support and even accelerate that destructive cycle: According to the Bureau of Justice Statistics, 68% of state prisoners are arrested again within three years. This system also isn't good for victims of crime. Retribution intentionally damages the offender, but it can also accidentally leave victims with new injuries by neglecting their needs and silencing their voices. In the present system, victims and their loved ones are barely involved in the process of meting out justice. As soon as the crime is committed, a huge professional apparatus kicks in, and a massive, inhuman bureaucracy takes over. The police, lawyers, investigators, jurors and judges all start doing whatever they think is right. Neither the crime victims nor their family members get to ask their own questions, determine the punishment or seek an apology. During a trial, practically everyone talks except the people actually impacted. After a trial, those convicted of a crime are sometimes legally forbidden to contact the people they hurt, even to offer an apology. The system attempts to shield survivors from unwanted contact with the wrongdoer, but that also robs victims of the opportunity to ask the questions that haunt them: "Why?" "What were you thinking?" "What were my son's last words?" As a result, the amount of communication between the two parties is practically nonexistent -- except for an impact statement from the victims, delivered right before the guilty party is sentenced. We know that this system isn't working. To help cure what ails our justice system, reform advocates say, we need to think differently. We need to think about restoration. Restorative justice shifts our understanding of crime and punishment and asks us to use a completely different logic. The goal is not to create more damage, but to create more healing -- often through a dialogue between a crime survivor and the person who hurt them. The goal is not to add more pain, but to ameliorate as much pain as possible. At the end of the day, the goal is for all parties -- and the community itself -- to be restored to whatever degree of wellness and wholeness is possible. It seeks accountability from the trespasser, but ultimately healing for everyone involved. That's why in these conversations between those who harmed and those who were harmed, there usually isn't a big audience or large army of professionals -- just a facilitator and some support people, maybe five people total. The process involves tremendous emotional and logistical preparation, including trading questions in advance. These exchanges come out of older, wiser traditions that recognize the many dimensions of harm, and that many threads of connection are severed when someone commits a crime. In these traditions, villagers would sit in circles, discuss the issue and find a just way forward -- to restore the dignity and sense of belonging for both the victim and the perpetrator. We are rediscovering that spiritual wisdom today, and it is changing lives. I recently visited San Quentin for an episode of "The Redemption Project" to meet a young man named Chris Smith. When Chris was 16, after a rough upbringing that led him into gang life, he says he followed orders to shoot at a car parked outside a high school. He did not realize that one of his former classmates -- LoEshé Lacy -- who was only 16 herself was in the car. LoEshé was killed and he had to face the consequences. Chris was convicted of murder and eventually found himself in San Quentin. The first few years were rough. But then he found a series of programs in prison that introduced him to restorative justice -- and for Chris, it changed everything. Through restorative justice, he began a process of rehabilitation and self-reflection that led to a remarkable dialogue with Donald Lacy, LoEshé Lacy's father. And Donald finally got more insight into what led Chris into gang culture and to the terrible decisions that took his daughter's life. I was lucky enough to witness the encounter -- and to film it for CNN viewers -- as a part of "The Redemption Project." The really good news is that something new is brewing, not just in San Quentin, but across the criminal justice system. In fact, it has even reached Washington. With massive bipartisan majorities, both houses of Congress last year passed The First Step Act, the most significant piece of criminal justice reform legislation in decades. The First Step Act began with a recognition that prisons can't just be places of punishment. They must also create opportunities for rehabilitation and transformation. The law expands programming throughout the federal prison system and adds incentives that encourage men and women to pursue classes that will help them successfully return to their families and communities. It also scaled back some of the harshest criminal penalties like mandatory life sentences for third-strike drug offenses and retroactively applies other reforms to give thousands of people an opportunity to petition a judge for their freedom. It also added important protections for incarcerated women, banned solitary confinement for juveniles, and much more. But we will still need second, third, and fourth steps -- fully implementing the act quickly and effectively, rolling back other lengthy prison sentences (and continuing to do so retroactively to bring home as many people as we safely can), investing in alternatives to incarceration, scaling back systems of mass supervision like probation and parole, reducing barriers for people with criminal records, and so much more. The First Step Act at least opens the door to begin that wholesale rethinking of our criminal justice system. No longer are retribution and incapacitation the sole aims of our public safety policies. Now, rehabilitation officially matters, too. And for some, nothing is more powerfully rehabilitative than sitting face-to-face with people you have harmed, in an effort to heal.

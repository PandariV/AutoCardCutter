# AutoCardCutter [WIP]
## An automatic Policy Debate card cutter in Python
### Directions:
####In any IDE, create a new Python project. Then, create a new Python script and copy the code from AutoCardCutter.py. Install the necessary packages, then run the program and follow the prompts. The cards will be cut to the cards.txt file (a new file will be created if the program doesn't find an existing one) where you can copy and paste it into a Word doc

### Flaws:
1. Can only cut cards from CNN (Should be solved soon)
2. Cannot yet auto highlight or tag cards
3. Can't do author qualifications
4. Program can't cut a few cards from CNN
5. Cards are not always relevant to the search term
